#### Howdy! Iâ€™m Matt Marks, a product manager, web designer, technical ninja, & creative jedi.

## About this repo:
This project is my personal website, mattmarks.com (among many other domain alias'). The project is built in HTML & CSS and pushed from my local to GitHub. I have recently transferred the DNS for my domains and the hosting of my website over to netlify.com, which automatically builds and deploys the website each time the repo is updated.
